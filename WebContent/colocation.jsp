				<h3>COLOCATION SERVICES AND HOSTING</h3>
				<p>
					Co-locate Your Server At Our Tier 3 Data Center<br>
			</center>
			Colocation is the foundation for your IT infrastructure deployment.
			The data center you choose are meant to support your application or
			website which determines the quality of every service you consume,
			from cloud, to managed hosting. Mail Wale data center and colocation
			services offer reliability, continuity and security for your
			applications, data and systems. Our data centers are conveniently
			located in major metropolitan areas. The Best Services facilities
			will be provided through our data center. Colocation gives you a
			dedicated environment for your IT hardware in a secure and globally
			connected facility. Whether you require managed colocation or prefer
			a hands-on approach, Mail Wale colocation data centers remove the
			need to build, staff and manage your in-house server rooms or data
			centers, giving you the freedom to focus on your business, and
			enhance growth in terms of profit.Server colocation is kind of
			similar to dedicated server hosting with a very small difference. In
			dedicated hosting the company needs to rent the servers along with
			the infrastructure, whereas the picture is slightly different in
			server colocation. In server colocation, the company has its’ own
			hardware and only looks out for rack-space to make the best use of
			their existing infrastructure within the unexcelled data center
			facilities. This will eliminate the hassle and cut out the cost for
			running your own data centers, which is a lot believe me.
